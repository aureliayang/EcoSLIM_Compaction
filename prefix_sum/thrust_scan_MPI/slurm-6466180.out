Warning: Open MPI has detected that you are running in an environment with CUDA
devices present and that you are using Intel(r) Ompi-Path networking. However,
the environment variable PSM2_CUDA was not set, meaning that the PSM2 Omni-Path
networking library was not told how to handle CUDA support.

If your application uses CUDA buffers, you should set the environment variable
PSM2_CUDA to 1; otherwise, set it to 0. Setting the variable to the wrong value
can have performance implications on your application, or even cause it to
crash.

Since it was not set, Open MPI has defaulted to setting the PSM2_CUDA
environment variable to 1.
